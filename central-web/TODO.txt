
	- monitoring UI
		tab "Control": 
x			clear history: implement form completely, simplify JS
x			activate/deactivate: convert to pure AJAX but how to cleanup?
		tab "Alerts":
x			filter alerts: convert to pure AJAX if not done already
x			remove home POST?
??			how to perform filter form validation (server/client sides)?
x			use scrollbar for alerts table
15'			add clear/reset filter input: AJAX
1h		- improve to replace globally all POST/GET with AJAX calls
			ensure somehow that refresh will always go back to the current tab(how?)
		
	- monitoring improvement:
1h		- check devices not pinging for too long
			- avoid logging an alert every second, use graduated alerts!
??		- should voltage alerts be repeated forever?
	- introduce concept of "priority" (or recurrent, repeated...) alerts that 
	shall always show first until they are "cleared"
	
30'	- if default config is changed, previous config must be forced inactive if needed
		- maybe need confirm message?
		
5'	- store INFO alerts about when config activated/deactivated

1h+	- propose function to cleanup alert history:
		- for a given config
		- for a given period of time
		- for a given level of alert
		
15'	- review all .py headers (encoding!)
15'	- ensure all classes use new-style classes (subclass object)
30'	- review all FIXME/TODO

	- improve DB model to:
		- have several codes for a config, each with an associated message
		  (typically: owner)
1h	- review models to ensure completeness of relationships and efficiency; in particular
	  try to limit manual queries performed in code if not needed!
		(search for .query.)
2h	- add correct SQL exception handling in all routes
		- unique key => special warning message
		- reference key => other special warning
	
30'	- refactor CSS files (one css per module, with same name as module or 
	  one unique name, the same across all modules...)
30'	- improve CSS files for every screen; check padding/margins in particular
45'	- review labels/titles everywhere




15'	- check no possible direct access to some routes
30'	- force password change (when password empty)

1h	- infer on i18n

	- add email?
	
2h	- add NRF24 and scanning thread
