
	- monitoring improvement:
1h		- check devices not pinging for too long
			- avoid logging an alert every second, use graduated alerts!
??		- should voltage alerts be repeated forever?
	- introduce concept of "priority" (or recurrent, repeated...) alerts that 
	shall always show first until they are "cleared"
	
30'	- if "current" config is changed, previous config must be forced inactive if needed
		- maybe need confirm message?
30'	- configuration changes of an active config should be limited
		- or there should be mechanisms to propagate change to MonitoringManager
		(because devices are deep copies of config devices, hence are not up-to-date)
		
15'	- review all .py headers (encoding!)
15'	- ensure all classes use new-style classes (subclass object)
1h	- rename "private" methods with leading underscore (convention)
30'	- review all FIXME/TODO

30'	- refactoring of JavaScript form validation through AJAX
30'	- monitoring UI:
		- improve error display in AJAX if possible 
		(avoid flash messages and replace with <p class="help-block">xxx</p>)
		not sure it is OK with inline forms?
	
	- improve DB model to:
		- have several codes for a config, each with an associated message
		  (typically: owner)
1h	- review models to ensure completeness of relationships and efficiency; in particular
	  try to limit manual queries performed in code if not needed!
		(search for .query.)
2h	- add correct SQL exception handling in all routes
		- unique key => special warning message
		- reference key => other special warning
	
30'	- refactor CSS files (one css per module, with same name as module or 
	  one unique name, the same across all modules...)
30'	- improve CSS files for every screen; check padding/margins in particular
45'	- review labels/titles everywhere

1h+	- improve function to cleanup alert history:
		- for a given config
		- for a given period of time
		- for a given level of alert
		
15'	- check no possible direct access to some routes
30'	- force password change (when password empty)

	- monitoring:
		- [LATER] filter alerts stored upon events when status is unlocked
			- eg presence detected
		
1h	- infer on i18n

	- add email?
	
2h	- add NRF24 and scanning thread
