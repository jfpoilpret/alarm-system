
1h	- review FIXME
1h	- review TODO
		
2h	- improve component loading:
		- factor GlobalViewModel and ComponentLoader into viewmodel-utils.js
		- VM should just specify the feature name
		- component binding should use feature name + type (dialog, content...)
		- make GlobalVM automatically find out all component elements in DOM
			- use class for real DOM elements, but how to deal with <!-- ko ... -->
		- remove console.log()

2h	- javascript: make it more modular?
		- investigate requirejs
		- how to create "subclasses"?
		
3h	- improve webargs to support bundle_errors

	- consider using marshmallow instead of flask restful marshalling?
	- remove flask-restful in the end?
		
	- open points/bugs:
		- bugs on "required" on server side: it is currently possible to create a user with empty name/fullname/password!
			-> this is due to not submitting the form!
		- all REST resources: improve webargs checks by providing dedicated checks
		
	- open questions:
		- validation? suggested to use jQuery validation: what's that?
		
	- security:
		- check prevention against SVG exploits
		
30'	- if "current" config is changed, previous config must be forced inactive if needed
		- maybe need confirm message?
30'	- configuration changes of an active config should be limited
		- or there should be mechanisms to propagate change to MonitoringManager
		(because devices are deep copies of config devices, hence are not up-to-date)
		
30'	- debug focus on profile dialog

30'	- review all FIXME/TODO

	- improve DB model to:
		- have several lock codes for a config, each with an associated message
		  (typically: owner)
2h	- add correct SQL exception handling in all REST calls POST/PUT
		- unique key => special warning message
		- reference key => other special warning
	
30'	- improve CSS for every screen; check padding/margins in particular
2h	- review labels/titles everywhere and review look overall

1h+	- improve function to cleanup alert history:
		- for a given config
		- for a given period of time
		- for a given level of alert
		
15'	- check no possible direct access to some routes
30'	- force password change (when password empty)

	- monitoring:
		- [LATER] filter alerts stored upon events when status is unlocked
			- eg presence detected
		
1h	- infer on i18n

	- add email?
	
2h	- add NRF24 and scanning thread
