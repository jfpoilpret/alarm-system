Alarm System Central Web Application - AVR-based Modules
========================================================

All modules can be built and uploaded as netbeans 8.0 projects.
Compilation of any module has some setup pre-requisites.

Arduino IDE
-----------
Netbeans setup needs AVR toolchain which is available from standard Arduino IDE install.
I currently use Arduino 1.6.6 on Windows 8.1 but any recent Arduino version on any Operating System should work fine.
